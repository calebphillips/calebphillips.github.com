          <h1>Micah</h1>

          <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

          <div>
            <p> 
              With so many conversations about justice and mercy lately, 
              the well known Micah 6:8 came to mind, so I decided to look it up
              again and make sure I remembered it.
            </p>
              <pre>
He has told you, O man, what is good;
    and what does the LORD require of you
but to do justice, and to love kindness,
    and to walk humbly with your God?
Micah 6:8, ESV
              </pre>

              <p>
              Yes, there it is.  Just three simple things. This is what the LORD <i>requires</i>
              of us.  
              </p>
              
              <p>
              But what is the context? Chapter 6 starts with an indictment from LORD against 
              his people.  God is asking what he has done to "weary" Israel.  He recalls how he
              brought them out of Israel and delivered them from Balak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then comes these questions in quotes:
            </p>

              <pre>
"With what shall I come before the Lord,
    and bow myself before God on high?
Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
    with calves a year old?
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams,
    with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
    the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
Micah 6:6-7, ESV
              </pre>

              <p>Is this a question from Israel?  Hypothetical or real?</p>
              
              <p>
              When I have read this without 1-5 as context, I have read
              the questions as a sincere plea for help.  Reading this time, right after the accusations,
              I wondered if there was a possibility it was sarcastic, especially in light  of verse 8 saying
              "He has told you" - you already know.  "Nothing would ever be enough for him, ugh!"
              The mention of sacrificing a child is interesting, too.  But I think it could just as
              easily be read, as I always have, as someone overwhelmed by their sin and trying to imagine 
              what magnitude of sacrifice could ever compare with it, finally realizing that not even 
              sacrificing their children would be enough.
            </p>

            <p>"Ten thousands of rivers of oils" is a particularly extravagant picture for me.</p>
              
            <p>
              Other thoughts:

              <ul>
                  <li>The crime that the LORD calls out in the following verses is "wicked scales" and
                      "deceitful wieghts" - in other words cheating people.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The consequences of the sin is that the work will not yield expected results.  Hard
                      work will not pay off if the LORD is opposed to you.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      "For you have kept the statues of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab".
                      Caught my eye due to current discussions of statues and history.
