            <p>I have been building software and software teams for 20 years.  </p>
            <p>
                My professional desire is to help organizations achieve their goals through
                the disciplined and thoughtful application of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been around long enough to go through a few cycles of hot new technologies.  
                I know that there is no substitute for understanding and communication when the goal
                is to help an organization succeed and not just to deliver features.  At the same time, 
                we do have access to a pretty amazing set of tools these days for building reliable, 
                scalable, secure systems without spending a fortune.
            </p>

                My most recent experiences have been with the "system of the system"  (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/">DevOps</a>).
                I have found that safe deployment pipelines are a powerful enabler of change and experimentation
                within an organization.  With the rich capabilities exposed by cloud providers, I am looking forward
                to helping organizations build safe systems of work, so that we can optimize our software for
                successful production performance and value delivered.
