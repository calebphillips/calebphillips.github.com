            <h1>The Psalms</h1>
    
            <h2>Psalm 46</h2>

            <h3>1-3</h3>
            <pre>
God is our refuge and strength,
    a very present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,
    though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
though its waters roar and foam,
    though the mountains tremble at its swelling.             
</pre>
            <p>
                God as our refuge is such a key picture from the Psalms.  
                The place that we can run to and receive shelter from the
                things that would buffet us.  There is an implication here 
                that there will be trouble and that we will need help. 
                The comfort is that God is "a very present help in trouble",
                not that God will help you to avoid trouble.  How often does
                our faith run aground because (maybe only deep down and unconsciously)
                we assume that to be helped means to avoid trouble, to find that
                place where we can hit cruise control.
            </p>
            <p>The alternate translation of "very present" in the ESV notes is
                "well proved".  I am so attached to the idea of God being "very present"
                in my trouble that I am a little hesitant to think about this being
                an alternative. But although the image might be a little different, I guess
                they add up to the same thing. It is "well proved" than whenever I have been
                in trouble, I have found God to be there as a helper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The author feels that his confidence in God's help is so strong 
                and well founded, that even if the earth under his feet disappeared,
                he would not be afraid.  For years, this has been my standard for 
                confronting fear.  The earth represents that which has sustained 
                out lives since human beings came into existence.  So if we can be
                without fear when the foundations of our existence are threatened, 
                it's probably reasonable to trust God through fears of rejection in
                our relationships and fears of failure in our callings.  Not to 
                mention fears of sickness and societal unrest.
            </p>

            <h3>4-7</h3>
            <p>The next picture is a little more mysterious to me.  Is the
                river a reminder that God favors Jerusalem?  The next verses shift right 
                back to the themes of presence and help: 
                <ul>
                    <li>"God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved."</li>
                    <li>"God will help here when morning dawns"</li>
                    <li>"The LORD of hosts is with us"</li>
                    <li>"The God of Jacob is our fortress"</li>
                </ul>

                These bring to mind some verses from Psalm 73
                
                <pre>
Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
    you hold my right hand.
You guide me with your counsel,
    and afterward you will receive me to glory.
Whom have I in heaven but you?
    And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
My flesh and my heart may fail,
    but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

For behold, those who are far from you shall perish;
    you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.
But for me it is good to be near God;
    I have made the Lord God my refuge,
    that I may tell of all your works.                    
                </pre>

                The NASB has "the nearness of God is my good".  That's another 
                foundational truth for me.  The nearness of God is the
                definition of goodness.  Psalm 46 is describing that nearness
                in the aspectÂ of a refuge, but it's even more general than that. 
                Again from Psalm 73, we have "God is the strength of my heart 
                and my portion forever."  God is my portion.  For me this brings
                up the division of the land in Israel.  God said that the Levites
                wouldn't have a share in the land because he would be their portion.
                So the psalmist is calling this to mind.  "When I look at what I could
                have, including land and a name and an inheritance to pass on, I see
                that the presence of God is a better deal than that."
            </p>    
            <p>Notice also that pattern that starts with scary stuff and then asserts
               Gods presence. v6 = scary, v7 = God's presence. v8-9 = scary, v10-11 = God's
               presence.
            </p>
            <h3>8-11</h3>
            <p>v8 and v9 are interesting.  v9 seems like happy images.  He's making
                wars cease and breaking the weapons.  But v8 is inviting us to 
                behold how God has brought desolations on the earth.  Is v8 how he
                brought about v9?  We know from Jeremiah that God brought desolation
                to Jerusalem.  I don't want to read into this, but it's something I'm
                trying to think about in the context of current events and nationalism.
                It seems like it's often taken for granted that we must protect our
                current situation at any cost (law and order rhetoric), when in fact
                God works desolations sometimes.  I don't know what other scriptues are
                used for order.  The stuff from 1 Corinthians 14 seems way out of context
                for how God deals with nations, whereas tearing down and setting up are 
                commonly ascribed to God as means for dealing with governments.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it all comes back to God with us in v11.  v10 is so familiar, but
                I noticed today that God repeats "I will be exalted".  It's assured.  He
                doesn't say, make sure you remember to exalt me, or I will bless your 
                country if you exalt me.  He says "I will be exalted"
